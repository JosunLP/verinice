0,0 Information Security Assessment,,"ISA provides the basis for
- a self-assessment to determine the state of information security in an organization (e.g. company)
- audits performed by internal departments (e.g. Internal Audit, Information Security)
- TISAXⓇ Assessments (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange, https://enx.com/tisax/)
ISA consists of several tabs, the content and function of which are explained in the tab “Definitions”. The corresponding actual requirements can be found in the tabs “Information Security”, “Prototype Protection” and “Data Protection”.

We recommend gaining an overview of the individual ISA tabs by using the “Definitions” tab. 
Then, commence with the “Information Security” tab.

The authors of this document wish you every success.

<b>Further information</b>
Introduction:
The requirements derived from the information security strategy and the context of the organization result in information security guidelines, which can be mapped in a multi-level document pyramid depending on the size of the company. The context of the organization results, among other things, from the corporate culture, customer requirements or legal requirements. An overarching guideline is usually the main document on the basis of which further guidelines and regulations are derived.

Justification:
Guidelines and regulations are the basis for joint action to achieve strategic corporate goals. Without central regulations that are visible to relevant persons, misunderstandings can arise from the point of view of information security and different decisions can be made, which consequently generate incalculable risks to information security. In addition, regulations are a basis for comparing the actual implementation with the written requirements in regular effectiveness checks and for identifying opportunities for improvement. 

Basic information:
It is important to consider the requirements of information security in business processes.  Requirements for information security means the level of security that ensures the safe handling of information.
The requirements can be brought to the organization from outside or arise from within the organization itself. 
The requirements of the individual ""interested parties"" must be aligned with the objectives of the organization and a strategy must be identified to achieve the requirements and objectives.

Employees will also find detailed explanations of the consequences of non-compliance with guidelines in the guidelines.  
The organization examines from its point of view the need for guidelines for achieving the objectives and for operating an ISMS and creates them. 
Since framework conditions can change, it makes sense to check the guidelines regularly, e.g. annually, for appropriateness and correctness.
Employees need access to the policies. A central location, such as the intranet, is recommended to ensure that you always have access to the latest version of a policy. This is where printed guidelines have significant disadvantages. 
A business partner may also need access to the guidelines, for example, because he assigns or transfers personnel within the scope of the ISMS. The need for contractual arrangements will be assessed by the organisation.

""Other relevant security policies"" designates all security-relevant policies that are not part of the ISMS and are relevant for Information Security.

<b>Possible questions (examples, not mandatory)</b>
- What information security requirements have been identified?
- What are the guidelines on information security?
- Who released them?
- Are the requirements aligned with the organization's goals?
- What are the objectives of the organization with regard to the ISMS and how are they to be achieved?
- Who is responsible for implementation?
- What are the consequences of not following the guidelines?
- Who regularly reviews the guidelines and when?

<b>Further information</b>
Introduction:
It is important for every organization to know the information that is of value to it (e.g. trade secrets, critical business processes, know-how, patents). These are called information assets (also called primary assets). The value of information results, among other things, from the economic benefit or the legal necessity (e.g. by laws, customer contracts) that the information creates in a certain situation, and the costs that have to be incurred. 
In addition, the need to protect these information assets is inherited by information carriers (also referred to as secondary assets) (e.g. IT systems, services/IT services, employees) that are connected. (See also Classification of Information in Control 1.3.2)

Justification:
An inventory of the information assets and the derived information carriers ensures that the organization has an overview of its information assets and can determine the protection needs for confidentiality, integrity and availability.
On this basis, an organization can determine fundamental protective measures to protect itself and the information assets/carriers.

Basic requirements:
Information values, information carriers and protection requirements change regularly (e.g. in the event of changes to the organisation, the IT landscape or processes). One task of the organization is to keep identified information values and information carriers up to date. A central process is helpful in order to obtain a complete overview of these values and carriers along the entire life cycle from generation/commissioning, use to destruction/deletion. Overviews of these information values and information carriers as well as the protection requirements are a supporting instrument in order to obtain and maintain a comprehensive overview.
For a comprehensive analysis of these information values, a look at the essential business processes and the information values processed in this process helps, since the protection requirements also depend on the process. In a further step, further information is relevant, the loss or disclosure of which would cause financial or reputational damage (e.g. patents, business documents, customer lists, customer contracts, personnel files, etc.).

Assets where security is of relevance are all assets where information or cyber security threats have relevant impact to the organization or its business. This includes IT systems, IT services, OT systems, IOT devices.

<b>Support: Examples Normal protection need</b>
It is not necessary to list all information assets individually; instead, categories can be established (e.g. master data of employees – responsible body: Human Resources)


<b>Possible questions (examples, not mandatory)</b>
- Which core processes are required to perform the company's task?
- What sensitive information do you receive from your customers?
- What information do you have in your company that is worth protecting?
- How is the process of identifying, recording and maintaining information values carried out?
- How are responsibilities for information assets determined?
- How is the handling of information values described?

- What evidence (e.g. impact analyses, etc.) is available? 
- How are the primary and supporting information values used determined, classified and documented?
- How and when are the directories checked for completeness, timeliness and traceability?
- How are the least critical information values evaluated and documented?

1.3.2,1.3.2 To what extent are information assets classified and managed in terms of their protection needs?,,"<b>Objective</b>
The objective of classifying information assets is the consistent determination of their protection needs. For this purpose, the value the information has for the organization is determined based on the protection goals of information security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and classified according to a classification scheme. This enables the organization to implement adequate protective measures.

<b>Requirements (must)</b>
+ A consistent scheme for the classification of information assets regarding the protection goal of confidentiality is available.
+ Evaluation of the identified information assets is carried out according to the defined criteria and assigned to the existing classification scheme. 
+ Specifications for the handling of supporting assets (e.g. identification, correct handling, transport, storage, return, deletion/disposal) depending on the classification of information assets are in place and implemented.

<b>Requirements (should)</b>
+ The protection goals of integrity and availability are taken into consideration.

<b>Further information</b>
Introduction:
The objective of the classification of information assets is a consistent determination of the need for protection. This allows the organization to standardize and apply appropriate security measures. The classification of information is based on the upstream determination of the possible information values and information carriers, which is described in more detail in Control 1.3.1.

Justification:
The unambiguous classification of information assets and the description of standardized and specified protective measures for handling information significantly reduces the scope for handling information assets. In this way, concrete guidelines help both the owners, users and additional departments such as IT to handle the information values appropriately.

<b>Possible questions (examples, not mandatory)</b>
- What protection levels are defined in the company and what criteria are used to classify them?
- What measures are defined for each protection level?
- How can the classification of the information be recognized by employees?
- How is information classified?
- What regulations are derived for the protection of information (storage media/documents)?
- How do employees know how to classify information?
- What are the tools for classifying the classification?
- How are information objects labelled?
- Who is responsible for classifying the classification?
- How are unmarked documents handled?
- What measures must be taken for each protection requirement in different situations (e.g. travel, destruction, storage, transport, storage)?
- What contact channels are available so that employees can receive support in classification?

<b>Further information</b>
Software determines the logic on how information is processed within the organization. A short and pragmatic approval helps to ensure that software does not generate irresponsible risks to the organization's information and infrastructure.

Evaluation and approval of software enables the organization to limit risks of unintended logic and at the same time is the basis of a solid vulnerability and patch management (see 5.2.5) as well as maintaining a compliant license management (see 7.1.1). Its important to also consider software for admin and maintenance use such as debugging and firmware updating tools. 
When it comes to software management, the first step should be to determine on which level software needs to be approved. Finding a good compromise between the need for security and practicallity is the main driver of this consideration. For example, dedicated approval of every application or software library that comes with the base installation of the operating system would be excessive in many scenarios. Similarly, the commitment to a specific device usually means that not approving necessary firmware and/or device drivers significantly impacts the devices usability.
A repository of approved software prevents that people inside your organization accidentally install unapproved or modified software. Maintaining software versions and patch levels simplifies patch-management, but does not necessarily mean that every patch needs to be individually evaluated before approval. 
Especially if you have software that allows you to conduct administrative tasks, additional requirements might be necessary. A tool allowing to monitor network traffic for security or debugging purposes or manipulate configuration of critical system might be restricted for use requiring individual approval while maintaining a 4-eyes principile.

Key is to keep the evaluation and approval processes simple enough to be practical. If approval becomes to difficult or time-consuming, your administration will become reluctant to approve relevant software and users in the organization will circumvent the appvoal process to get the software they need. Accordingly, a good evaluation process is  designed, to adapt to the protection need of the software. This means first of all, to decide on the level of evaluation necessary for specific classes of software.

When it comes to evaluation, the control already gives good indications what steps the evaluation processes should follow:
+ Determine the intended or forseeable use scenario of the software and what security requirements apply for that scenario (i.e. is the approval including special high risk scenarios with specific security requirements or is the approval for normal risk use cases with a limited set of security requirements only)
+ Determine if your organization has the right to use the software (i.e. does the (to be) acquired licensing permit the intended use-case)
+ Consider the source of the software. Do your organization trusts the source (e.g. is it provided or distributed by a known and trusted software vendor)

The outcome of these three steps will determine additional evaluation need. When deciding on further steps, keep in mind that further testing or evaluation might not only remidiate risks, but also creates a time delay which can be a risk in itself. For example, in many cases the risk of not installing a security relevant patch because testing has not been conducted11 yet is higher than the risk that the patch creates issues that would have been detected by testing. A good approach always aims to find an appropriate balance.

Accordingly, granularity of software approval vary by scenario and can be very broad. For example, it might be practical to approve all system software that comes with a baseline operating system installation (i.e. operating system components, drivers, etc.). Also approval of trusted software repositories (i.e. based on the app classification of a mobile device store or operating system distribution) can be a valid approach, especially when limited to use in standard scenarios (i.e. without access to information with a significant protection need) 
 
When it comes to the type of approval, its important to notice that there is no need to keep centrallized approval lists. Based of the organization, the approval can be done in a decentralized way (i.e. in some cases, the development department has its specific evaluation and approval capabilities within the framework of the centralized processes). Similarly, its often more pratical and accurate to maintain an overview over installed software versions and patch levels by automated management tools rather than by manually maintaining lists. 

<b>Support: Examples Normal protection need</b>
The protection need of software can be derived from the intended use-case or from the design of the software. This means all software that do not have access to information with high or very confidentiality or integrity need and that does not run on systems that have high or very high availability requirements can be considered software with normal protection need. Additionally, software where the risk to information is limited by the fact that it is not designed to access relevant information and does not have elevated privilegies can be considered having a normal protection need.

An organization might adopt the following policiy: For normal protection need software, a bulk-approval based on licensing terms and a well-known or otherwise sufficiently trusted distributor seems the appropriate solution. If the software in question is not available from trustworthy distributor, the organization will do a brief evaluation of the software functionality by testing the software for obvious undesired functionality such as adware or spyware by means of individual recherche and testing.

Updated software will regularly inherit the approval of previous versions unless significant changes are detected.

<b>Support: Examples High protection need</b>
For this example, software that has only access to information with high protection need in terms of availability or integrity or are relevant for availability on systems with a respective need or software that faces specific security risks (software that is used to communicate with untrusted communication ends such as externally reachable server software, network clients such as web browsers), is considered software with high protection need. 

For such software and use-cases, the example organization may maintanin a list of repositories and vendors that are trusted for these cases (such as baseline software installation of the operating system and drivers and firmware for the used hardaware with well-known licensing terms). To get to this list, a vendor and repository can either be well-known and widely accepted (i.e. common operating systems and their base software, drivers for standard hardware) or individually known by the organization (such as a vendor for special hardware or machines that have been carefully selected. A software that is not on such a list can be individually evaluated by checking licensing conditions and then searching for bad reputation and finally by doing a test-installation to check for undesired available features or functionality such as adware or spyware. 

Updated software will regularly inherit the approval of previous versions unless significant changes are detected.

<b>Support: Examples Very high protection need</b>
For this example, software that has access to information with very high protecton need in terms of availability and integritcy or software that is relevant for the availability of Critical IT Systems.

Even such software and use-cases , the example organization may maintanin a list of repositories and vendors that are trusted for these cases (such as baseline software installation of the operating systems designed for the purpose and drivers and firmware for the used hardaware with well-known licensing terms. However, to gain the trust the vendor and distributor must have an excellent reputation.  All other software is individiually approved. Depending on the risk profile, this may include not only testing but also careful analysis of available documentation (or even a technical audit of the functionality of a specific software). Change logs for software wil 

Updated software will regularly inherit the approval of previous versions for minor software versions. However, the organization will actively monitor release notes and (if available) relevant other sources to detect changes that might require a re-evaluation. Major software versions always require re-evaluation before approval.

<b>Further information</b>
Introduction:
The concept of security zones basically describes different physical areas with different protection requirements. How a corresponding zone is to be protected is derived from the protection requirements of the assets located there. The more important the assets located there, the higher the protection requirements of the security zone.
For example, personnel data or prototype data and the areas in which they are processed are more sensitive than areas of the canteen where menus are displayed.
In principle, each company can freely choose the number of existing zone types. One approach would be, for example, to link the classification levels ""public"" to, for example, ""strictly confidential"" and the analogous definition of 4 security zones.

Basic information:
An effective security zone concept separates different security zones from each other by means of suitable measures. These separations can be represented by the following measures, among others:
- Technical measures such as detectors and alarm monitoring.
- Physical measures such as the use of walls, doors, locking systems
- Personnel measures such as security guards, doormen, receptionists
- Organizational measures such as processes for granting and withdrawing access authorizations.
Only if a zone is separated from the previous zones by one or more measures, it can be considered as an independent zone. If there is no protective measure between the respective security zones, the higher security zone falls back to the lower zone.
Using the example of an open-plan office, it is not possible to define one part as a highly sensitive zone for handling strictly confidential data, for example, and the other part as an internal zone.
Using the example of a server room, this falls back to the protection level of the existing area such as corridors if the doors to the server room are not locked and no monitoring takes place.

Security zones should be built on the basis of an onion-shell model. A highly protected zone is usually not adjacent to a public area (e.g. The prototype warehouse is located directly next to the publicly accessible canteen). Ideally, between a public area and a highly sensitive area such as the prototype warehouse, there is an ""internal"" zone as a buffer, which only the company's own employees can enter.
A direct derivation of protective measures from the security zones is the implementation of the need-to-know principle. The more security-relevant the security zone, the fewer people should be able to enter the area. For example, if the entire workforce can enter an open-plan office, only administrators usually need access authorizations for the server room. For the implementation of a security zone concept, the implementation of an access concept is therefore always necessary. However, it should be noted that locking concepts do not correspond 1-to-1 with the security zones, since, for example, a prototype responsible for the highly sensitive zone of the prototype protection may not enter the highly sensitive zone of the server room, or the administrator does not necessarily have to enter prototype areas.

The definition of security zones can affect the following areas, among others: 
- Technical measures: use of alarm systems, motion detectors, video cameras + Physical measures: walls, barbed wire, fences, resistance classes of doors & windows
- Personnel measures: use of doormen, security services with stripes, use of external service providers such as cleaning companies
- Organizational measures: Allocation of access authorizations (need-to-know), frequency of rights review of access authorizations; the introduction of sound recording devices; masking of optics from smartphones of employees and employees; Clear Screen and Clean Desk requirements; visitor registration requirements; Conclusion of confidentiality agreements (GHV); Use or prohibition of smart devices (e.g. with microphones)
#####Technik with organizational measures#####

Design aids for defining security zones in the security zone concept:
The use of a zone scheme based on the classification scheme with four zone types has established itself as good practice for security zones: public area, normal protection area, high protection area and very high protection area. It is easier to transfer the protection requirements of the assets into a zone scheme, especially when first sketching security zones.
It has also proven to be useful to mark the security zones on premises and building floor plans in color in order to provide the company itself and possible auditors with a quick overview of the location of the security zones. One possibility is the use of clearly defined and intuitive colors for each security zone. For example, the following color scheme could be chosen:
 + Gray colors = Public areas 
 + Green Colors = Internal Areas
 + Yellow colors = Areas with high protection needs (e.g. Confidential)
 + Red colors = Areas with very high protection needs (e.g. Strictly Confidential)

<b>Support: Examples Normal protection need</b>
For example, security zones can be represented as follows:
- Public (typical color coding in the security zone plan: grey): Public street, parking lot without fences, company premises if no fencing is present, stairwell in a house with several tenants.
- Normal protection requirements (typical color coding in the security zone plan: green) (e.g. internal data): Company premises, if a complete fencing is given, reception areas, conference rooms, corridors, general areas where every employee can stay, but these cannot be entered from the public areas.
- Special protection requirements (typical color coding in the security zone plan: purple): server room, infrastructure switch and distribution rooms, chemical warehouse

Example of a zone with normal protection requirements:
The following example contains selected measures for an open-plan office of the shipping department, in which only internal information such as shipping information, delivery notes and package labels are produced and processed. The classification of the assets located there has at most an ""internal character"".
- Example of technical measures: The open-plan office has not implemented any separate technical protection measures.
- Example of physical measures: The façade as well as doors and windows are built in solid construction and thus enable a resistance class against burglary according to RC 2 according to DIN EN 1627. Doors to the open-plan office are open during the day so that every employee of the company can enter the room at any time. In the evening the door is locked.
- Example of personnel measures: At night, a security service sporadically carries out strip searches. An external cleaning company cleans the open-plan office unattended outside regular working hours and uses its own keys.
- Example of organizational measures: Each employee of the open-plan office has his own key. A ban on the use of company and private smartphones is not pronounced. Employees can use these devices freely. A review of the assigned access authorizations takes place sporadically. Employees are allowed to leave documents such as delivery notes on the tables after work. Visitors (and suppliers) may enter the area alone after registration and if necessary and do not have to conclude an explicit confidentiality agreement in advance.

<b>Support: Examples High protection need</b>
For example, security zones can be represented as follows:
- High protection requirements (typical color coding in the security zone plan: yellow/orange) (e.g. confidential data): HR department, design office, IT office, management offices

Example of a zone with high protection needs:
The following example contains selected measures for design offices in which tender documents, specifications and calculations are created, edited and stored. The classification of the assets located there has a ""confidential character"".
- Example of technical measures: The design office is equipped with motion sensors. After the daily working hours, the alarm system for the entire building is activated at 22:00 and automatically deactivated at 6:00.
- Example of physical measures: The façade as well as doors and windows are built in solid construction and thus enable a resistance class against burglary according to RC 2 according to DIN EN 1627. Doors to the design office are open during the day when construction employees are working within the zone. In the evening and in the absence of the employees, the door is locked.
- Example of personnel measures: At night, a security service carries out sporadic strip searches. An external cleaning company cleans the design office during regular working hours only under the supervision of employees present. The cleaning company does not have its own keys to the design office.
- Example of organizational measures: Only employees of the construction have their own key. A ban on the use of company and private smartphones is not pronounced. Employees can use these devices freely, but there is a ban on taking photographs in the room. A review of the assigned access authorizations takes place once a year. Employees of the construction are obliged to lock confidential documents in cabinets after work. Visitors (and suppliers) are not allowed to enter the area alone and are accompanied in this area at all times.

<b>Support: Examples Very high protection need</b>
For example, security zones can be represented as follows:
- Very high protection requirements (typical color coding in the security zone plan: red) (e.g. strictly confidential data): prototype area, project offices for customers.

Example of a zone with high protection needs:
The following example contains selected measures for a project office with special customer projects. The classification of the assets located there is ""strictly confidential"".
- Example of technical measures: The area is equipped with motion sensors. When leaving the area, it is alarmed. A loud siren sounds when a burglary attempt is made. In addition, the alarm system is connected to a security service.
- Example of physical measures: The façade as well as doors and windows are built in solid construction and thus enable a resistance class against burglary according to RC 2 acc. DIN EN 1627. The area has an external knob so that it is not possible to forget to close the door. So a key must always be used to enter the room. In addition, door closers are fitted to ensure that the door does not remain open.
- Example of personnel measures: External service providers may only enter the area in exceptional cases, after prior announcement and registration, accompanied by employees of the area. Employees are qualified and sensitized before obtaining project-related access permits.
- Example of organizational measures: Only employees of the department have their own key. A review of the assigned access authorizations takes place once a year.

<b>Further information</b>
Introduction:
The term ""supporting asset"" refers to all media on which information can be permanently stored. These include fixed IT devices (e.g. workstation PCs, workstations, servers, etc.), mobile IT devices (e.g. USB sticks, memory cards, notebooks, smartphones, etc.) as well as analogue media such as paper documents. For all supporting assets, information security and thus a secure application from creation to use to disposal is of fundamental importance. 

Justification:
During the entire life cycle of supporting assets, there is a risk that sensitive information, e.g. If the data is not adequately protected, it can be lost and/or spied on. Therefore, supporting assets are to be protected according to the need for protection of the information stored on them.

Basic information:
Before the creation phase, therefore, the question of the need for protection and the associated classification of the supporting assets already arises. These are usually dependent on the information values (information assets) that are stored on them (see Control 1.3.1 and 1.3.2). Based on the need for protection under the classification, appropriate protective measures for the creation, use and disposal of the supporting assets can then be defined and implemented.

<b>Requirements (must)</b>
+ The requirements for mobile IT devices and mobile data storage devices are determined and fulfilled. The following aspects are considered: 
  - Encryption,
  - Access protection (e.g. PIN, password),

Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in IT systems, for example, to gain access to the network and thus to information carriers and information values. Vulnerability detection therefore plays a central role in information security. It is the basis for the necessary vulnerability management and thus also for the following risk analyses and derivation of measures.

Basic information:
Since exploited vulnerabilities can have extremely far-reaching effects, especially if the attack is not detected at all (e.g. ""listening"" without direct damage), a systematic approach makes sense. It is important to obtain as much information as possible about the IT systems used in your own organization and external systems, such as:
- Operating Systems
- Firmware
- Apps
- Cloud Services 

An ISMS can generally play to its strengths here. Controls that can help here are, for example:
- Defining responsibilities (see 1.2.2 and 1.2.4)
- Identify relevant systems (cf.1.3.1)
- Identify risks (see 1.4.1)
- Training and sensitizing employees (see 2.1.3)
- Preparation for exceptional situations (see 3.1.2)
- Change Management (see 5.2.1)
- Review of information systems (see 5.2.6)

<b>Possible questions (examples, not mandatory)</b>
- What information about technical vulnerabilities can be determined?
- What are your sources?
- Where do you list hardware and software?
- How do you reconcile this information with your IT systems?
- Which vulnerabilities can be identified on the basis of risk assessments?
- When do you respond to identified vulnerabilities?
- How is the process from identification to elimination of the vulnerability defined?

<b>Further information</b>
Within the context of ISA, the term contractor includes both classic suppliers and subcontractors but also classic service providers, freelancers or other partner companies. It also includes cooperation partners (e.g. academic institutions, institutes).

The explanations below describe a possible procedure for fulfilling the requirements:

Identification of contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:
At first, all contractors must be identified (e.g. via the list of creditors of the accountants department) in order to gain an initial overview. 
For all contractors, the respective protection needs should be specified and the security requirements derived according to their tasks and the relevance to own and customer’s processes. 
Generally, a large number of contractors is found not to require the assignment of relevant protection needs and to be therefore not subject to security requirements (e.g. suppliers of office stationary). 

Ensuring implementation by the contractor:
In the next step, the applicable requirements must be made known to all security-relevant contractors in a suitable manner and (contractually) fixed as being mandatory. Finally, a decision should be made as to how the implementation of the security requirements can be appropriately verified. For this purpose, adequate verification processes and procedures should be defined according to the respective risk (and the associated protection needs). Their purpose is to ensure that contractors implement the necessary requirements.

Establishment in standard processes:
The insights gained should be used to develop a comprehensible procedure and to integrate it into the existing processes of the B2B / supplier management. This starts with the selection of the contractor, where aspects of information security should already be considered alongside criteria such as quality, adherence to delivery dates, credit rating etc. The procurement process should be such that the relevance of information security has already been considered beforehand (with respect to the procurement decision; contract design; inspection requirements).
Furthermore, it is recommended to incorporate information security aspects into existing processes for supplier evaluation which have already been established by e.g. an existing quality management system.
Contractually specified deliverables (e.g. availability requirements) should be verified at regular intervals. This can be done by e.g. regular analysis of service reports and SLAs.  

<b>Support: Examples Normal protection need</b>
Identification of contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:
It is crucial for this evaluation, whether the contractor’s work includes
1) gaining access to information or security zones of the company with normal protection needs regarding confidentiality; or
2) providing or being able to modify relevant information with normal protection needs regarding integrity; or
3) having relevant influence on processes or IT systems with normal protection needs regarding availability (comp. to internal or customer-related SLAs).
Typical contractors with normal protection needs are e.g. cleaning services for general areas, classic logistics companies or maintenance staff.

The minimum requirements for information security (in relation to the respective protection goal) should be defined in a policy (e.g. information security policy for service providers). These requirements can be based on the requirements of the ISA described herein in addition to the company-specific requirements. This policy can be supplemented according to the specific order.

Ensuring implementation by the contractor:
The security requirements should be made known to the contractor, e.g. at procurement, in briefings (project meetings) by corresponding documents (e.g. information security policy for service providers) or when entering the premises (in case of contractors providing their services on site). Compliance with the information security requirements should be contractually fixed. At this point already, potential further subcontractors of the contractor should also be considered, as relevant. This can be done by individual agreements such as general terms and conditions of purchase, for example.  In many cases, suppliers (e.g. IT service providers) already assure compliance with security requirements in their standard contracts.

In order to ensure compliance with the requirements in a suitable manner, simple mechanisms should be established. This may include, for example:
- The submission of at least a self-disclosure confirmed by the management (e.g. ISA) or an adequate attestation/certificate
- The right to and execution of irregular sampling and event-related inspections.

<b>Support: Examples High protection need</b>
Identification of contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:
It is crucial for this evaluation, whether the contractor’s work includes
1) gaining access to information or security zones of the company with high protection needs regarding confidentiality; or
2) providing or being able to modify relevant information with high protection needs regarding integrity; or
3) having relevant influence on processes or IT systems with at least high protection needs regarding availability (comp. to internal or customer-related SLAs).
Typical contractors with high protection needs are e.g. cleaning services autonomously cleaning relevant security zones, IT service providers (e.g. data base administrators), consultants, agencies and subcontractors (e.g. tool designers to whom project data need to be forwarded).

Obviously, contractors with high protection needs are subject to the minimum information security requirements regarding the respective protection goal. These requirements should be supplemented particularly by necessary general (see e.g. ISA high protection needs) and order-specific requirements.

Ensuring implementation by the contractor:
Here, the procedure described for normal protection needs can be used for orientation.
Besides the obligation regarding implementation of an adequate information security level and the non-disclosure obligation, a right to audit should be contractually fixed or appropriate controls (regular auditing of the contractor) should be ensured. This may also include an obligation to participate in TISAX.

In order to ensure compliance with the requirements in a suitable manner, simple mechanisms should be established. This may include, for example:
- contractor requires TISAX label for high protection needs or equivalent (e.g. ISO 27001, certificate of corresponding scope)
- right to and execution of regular sampling and event-related inspections.



<b>Support: Examples Very high protection need</b>
Identification of contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:
It is crucial for this evaluation, whether the contractor’s work includes
1) gaining access to information or security zones of the company with very high protection needs regarding confidentiality; or
2) providing or being able to modify relevant information with very high protection needs regarding integrity; or
3) having relevant influence on processes or IT systems with at least very high protection needs regarding availability (comp. to internal or customer-related SLAs).
Typical contractors with very high protection needs are IT service providers (e.g. domain administrators), consultants, agencies, subcontractors (e.g. CAD designers to whom extensive project data of very high protection needs need to be forwarded) and prototype manufacturers.

Obviously, contractors with very high protection needs are subject to the minimum information security requirements regarding the respective protection needs. These requirements should be supplemented particularly by necessary general (see e.g. ISA very high protection needs) and order-specific requirements. The difference to high protection needs is essentially the number and quality of the necessary additional requirements.

Ensuring implementation by the contractor:
Here, the procedure described for high protection needs can be used for initial orientation.
Besides the obligation regarding implementation of an adequate information security level and the non-disclosure obligation, a right to audit should be contractually fixed or appropriate controls (regular auditing of the contractor) should be ensured. This should also include an obligation to participate in TISAX.

In order to ensure compliance with the requirements in a suitable manner, simple mechanisms should be established. This may include, for example:
- contractor requires TISAX label for very high protection needs
- right to and execution of regular and event-related thorough inspections (if applicable, supplemented with supporting certificates).

<b>Further information</b>
Introduction: 

Durch laws, regulations such as standards, contracts or even specially imposed requirements result in different requirements for processes, infrastructure, projects and / or workflows. Some of these requirements relate specifically to information security. Control therefore helps to identify and understand the existing requirements and to regulate the handling to meet the requirements. 
Reason:
Die risks arising from non-compliance with specifications can result in serious financial and material damage as well as reputation-damaging consequences in one's own company or with customers and business partners. If requirements and specifications are not complied with or are not determined, this may result in breaches of contract or laws with corresponding consequences or risks for the company and its business partners.
Basic information: 
Im general, Control is concerned with determining and monitoring compliance with requirements arising from laws, regulations and contracts as well as self-imposed requirements. The focus is on the relevance to the ISMS. It can be helpful here to first identify all relevant requirements, check them regularly and collect them in a kind of legal cadastre. In addition, it is necessary to define, in accordance with the requirements, how the corresponding provisions are to be fulfilled and for which group of persons these provisions are relevant. This can be done, for example, in the context of guidelines, action plans or work instructions that have been made known to the corresponding responsible persons.
If requirements arise with regard to the integrity of documents and records, such as protection against loss, retention periods or access authorizations, these must also be recorded and considered.

<b>Support: Examples Normal protection need</b>
Corresponding provisions can be included in the following, for example:
- Author’s rights
- Cryptography
- Copyright
- Intellectual property
- Archiving
- Information security legislation
- Data protection
- Trade Secrets Act
- Contractually agreed provisions (GTC, terms and conditions of purchase, framework contracts, individual contracts)


<b>Possible questions (examples, not mandatory)</b>

- What are the contents of awareness-raising activities?
- How do you ensure that the awareness-raising measures reach all employees?

Intellectual property:
- What are the contractual provisions on ""intellectual property"" in the contracts with subcontractors? 
- What are the contractual provisions on ""intellectual property"" in the employee contracts?

License:
- How do you handle licenses for internal use (license management)? 
- What is your policy on the use of licenses?
- What is your policy on downloading software from the Internet?

Open source:
- How is the use of ""Open Source"" products in software development regulated?
